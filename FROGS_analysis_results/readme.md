#  How to use the python scripts in `scripts/` ?



You need to have plotly and pandas installed to run the local python script used to post process and plot the table generated by FROGS. You create a conda environement with this dependencies for example:

1. Clone this repository to have the scripts locally


```bash
git clone https://github.com/geraldinepascal/RPOB_paper.git
```

2. Create a conda environement to run the python script


To do that you can simply create a python environement with conda:

```bash
conda create -n metabar_analysis pandas plotly
conda activate metabar_analysis
 
```


3. Try to generate the help of a python script

```bash
python RPOB_paper/FROGS_analysis_results/scripts/plot_taxo_ranks.py -h

```
